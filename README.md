# Tower of Sin

**Developers:** Evelyn Johnson, Mario Tinoco, and Soham Hisabia.<br>
Created in Spring 2026 in CS 426 - Video Game Design and Development at the University of Illinois Chicago.

## Concept

**Tower of Sin** is a 3D action-roguelike dungeon crawler where players ascend a tower, battling enemies and bosses representing humanity's fatal flaws (like Greed, Pride, and Wrath). You play as a condemned soul seeking redemption and escape from eternal torment by overcoming these sins.

Can **YOU** prove your redemption?

## Lore
You are a condemned soul. In order to prove you’ve been redeemed, you must traverse the Tower of Sin and defeat humanity’s fatal flaws: pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath, and sloth. Only by climbing high enough to reach the end of the tower, can you truly escape.

Sample Narration Quotes:
* Ah, another sinful soul. Come. Cross the river. (of Styx sort of vibe)
* You have lived a life trapped by temptation. She is what brings you here.
* If you so want to, you may escape your eternal torment by proving your redemption.
* Climb the tower. Overcome humanity’s greatest flaws. Cleanse your sins. This is how you leave.
* Items you gather along the way can be used to assist you in your battles. You can equip them here.
* Challenge the Sins, if you dare. Through the gates you must go.
* Beware, for if you fail, you lose it all. Happy hunting, O’ Burdened One.
* A soul cannot die a second time. However, you must start from the floor of the tower once more.
* Here is your realm of souls, an in-between while your fragments piece themselves together again. Your soul remembers how high you’ve climbed. Use that to your benefit the next time you try.
* (Ready to respawn) When you are ready, simply open your eyes.

## Key Formal Elements

* **Static Boundaries, Dynamic Rules:** Floors are structurally identical, but the gameplay stays fresh by randomizing the rules, procedures, debuffs, exits, enemy/loot spawns, and loot drops. 
* **Risk vs. Reward Encounters:** Mini-bosses do not block the exits. Players must choose whether to rush past the boss to the exit to escape quickly or risk their limited HP by fighting for the loot. 
* **Unique Bosses and Boss Mechanics:** Sin Bosses feature modifiers that can change the physical/visual properties of the room, the player, and other unique mechanics (e.g., spawn a copy of itself). For example, the "Sloth" boss increases the player's gravity and decreases their speed.
* **RNG Loot System:** Loot drops rely on RNG, where items have base stats modified by a rarity multiplier and an additional RNG modifier. This means that you will rarely get the same item, of the same rarity, with the same exact stats.
* **Meaningful Progression:** The game features permadeath where all run progress and loot are wiped if HP reaches zero. However, players return to the "Realm of Souls" (inspired by the Asphodel Meadows) to view cosmetic "Trophies" and equip permanent, stat-boosting "Titles".

Designed for mid-core gamers who enjoy fast-paced combat, unique boss mechanics, and high-replayability loops (similar to Hades 2, Minecraft Dungeons, and Cult of the Lamb).
